You may use your preferred package manager to perform these installations.

Doxygen is required to generate the documentation.
Documentation can be built by typing:

Graphviz is required to generate useful diagrams in the documentation.

Doxyfile.in is the configuration file.
Please refer to Doxygen documentation to obtain further information about it.
Note that there are two ways of configuring Doxygen:
1. one can edit Doxyfile.in directly
2. one can use doxywizard, the graphical user interface of Doxygen.

Doxywizard can be installed on Ubuntu systems by typing:
    sudo apt-get install doxygen-gui
Then, one can type 
    doxywizard Doxyfile.in
from the directory containing Doxyfile.in

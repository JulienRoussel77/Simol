\subsection{The compiler (...) does not support -std=c++11 flag.}

\Simol relies on some features of the 2011 norm of C++ but your compiler does not seem to support this norm. You need to provide another compiler by passing to the \texttt{cmake} command a correct value of the \texttt{CMAKE\_CXX\_COMPILER} variable. For example, the very first version of \texttt{GCC} which supports the C++11 norm is 4.8.1. If you have installed this version in \url{/usr/local/gcc/4.8.1}, you need to type
\lstset{language=bash} 
\begin{lstlisting}
cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/gcc/4.8.1/bin/g++
\end{lstlisting}
during the compilation step.

\subsection{Cloning into 'simol'... Permission denied (publickey)}

This message means that something goes wrong when you try to connect \SourceSup with you SSH key. You should verify that your key is effectively activated with the command
\lstset{language=bash} 
\begin{lstlisting}
ssh-add -l
\end{lstlisting}
If you obtain something like this:
\lstset{language=bash} 
\begin{lstlisting}
The agent has no identities
\end{lstlisting}
then your key is not activated. To activate it, you have to type add your key:
\lstset{language=bash} 
\begin{lstlisting}
ssh-add mykey
\end{lstlisting}
where \textit{mykey} is the full name of your key (including its path).
